        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Stanley Huang, I'm originally from Los Angeles and I'm 22 years old. My hobbies include playing video games, watching comedy TV shows, listening to music, and exercising. I recently graduated from University of California, San Diego as an International Business major. While I really enjoyed learning about the ins and outs of marketing, finance, sales, operations, project management, etc., I would love the chance to explore a deeper interest of mine: coding! I've always wanted to do something related to tech, but my insecurity and self-doubt have prevented me from doing so. After graduating early from college, I've decided to take the next few months to try and learn how to code on my own. So far it's been really frustrating.. but also really fun! My goal is to become a full stack engineer for a top company. While I still have a long way to go, I think this journey will be worth pursuing.</p>
